Forecasts are statements about future events based on past and present data. We use these statements as information to guide our behaviour in order to improve our future. Eventually, the purpose of every science as a whole is to develop forecasts for this very reason. Risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting. The uncertainty that accompanies specific forecast statements is crucial to evaluate how much weight to put on this statement in future decisions. Therefore, to report the accompanying uncertainty should be part of every serious scientific forecast, or, to put it mildly, has to be considered as a good scientific practice.

The next section introduces the reader to important concepts in the literature. Therefore, it is placed before the literature review.
